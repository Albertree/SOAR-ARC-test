## Session 2 Analysis — 2026-03-25 00:39

### Strategies added (agent/active_operators.py)

1. **scale_up** — each input cell becomes an NxN block in the output (factor=2 for c59eb873)
   - `_try_scale_up`: detects uniform integer scaling across all example pairs
   - `_apply_scale_up`: expands each cell into factor×factor block

2. **flip_stack** — output is input stacked with its vertical or horizontal mirror
   - `_try_flip_stack`: checks if output = [original | reversed(original)] along one axis
   - `_apply_flip_stack`: concatenates original rows with reversed rows

3. **recolor_by_size** — connected components recolored by their cell-count rank
   - `_try_recolor_by_size`: verifies single source color, consistent size→color mapping
   - `_apply_recolor_by_size`: groups components, assigns colors by size lookup

### Results

| Task | Before | After | Rule |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| c59eb873 | INCORRECT (identity) | CORRECT | scale_up |
| 8be77c9e | INCORRECT (identity) | CORRECT | flip_stack |
| 6e82a1ae | INCORRECT (identity) | CORRECT | recolor_by_size |

**Score: 0/20 (0.0%) → 3/20 (15.0%)**
