## Iter 1 -- 2026-05-13 -- branch test20

**Diagnosis**: The probe solved 0/3 and saved 0 rules. Root cause is upstream of
solving: `agent/conditions/` does not exist, so there is no recognition
vocabulary the slow path could even attach to a rule's `condition.type`. P5
(distinct condition matchers) is 0 — the foundational scaffold for the
`{condition, action}` schema is absent. Smallest defensible step: stand up the
condition-matcher registry plus one foundational matcher, and leave
`active_operators.py` / `memory.py` untouched.

**Change**:
- `agent/conditions/__init__.py` (new) -- `CONDITION_REGISTRY` dict, `register`
  decorator, auto-import of sibling modules so `@register` runs on import.
- `agent/conditions/grid_size_preserved.py` (new) -- first matcher: returns True
  iff every example pair has matching input/output dimensions. Foundational
  precondition for any same-grid transformation rule.
- `docs/RULE_FORMAT.md` -- §4 condition registry table updated with the new
  entry; §7 implementation status updated.

**Probe before**: score=0/3, rules=0, covers_mean=0.0
**Probe after** : (not re-run -- this iter does not affect solve path)

**Invariants**: forbidden=none, positives=P5: 0 -> 1 (one matcher registered);
P1-P4, P6 unchanged. Manually verified F1-F8 all clean (frozen files
untouched; no `_try_*`/`_apply_*` added; no DSL primitive added; no rule files
saved; no TF_ artifacts; no budget auto-grow; no swallowed RuleSchemaError;
`active_operators.py` not modified).

**Infra note (next iter to address, not a commitment)**: `scripts/check_invariants.sh`
hardcodes `python3`, but on this Windows machine `python3` resolves to the
Microsoft Store stub that prints "Python" and exits 0 without running. The
pre-iter snapshot at `logs/_invariant_snapshot.json` was therefore left empty
(0 bytes) and check mode would fall through to `BASE_HEAD=HEAD~1`. Invariants
this iter were verified manually with raw `git diff` against HEAD. Replacing
`python3` with `python` (or detecting the stub) would unblock automated
checking on this host.

**Next gap (note for future iter)**: `agent/memory.py:save_rule_to_ltm()` still
writes the legacy schema (top-level `rule` field, no `condition`/`action`) --
it would trip F4 the moment any rule actually gets saved. Adding
`RuleSchemaError` plus a real `save_rule()` that emits the §3.2 schema is the
natural next smallest step now that the condition registry exists to validate
`condition.type` against.

## Iter 2 -- 2026-05-13 -- branch test20

**Diagnosis**: The probe again solved 0/3 and saved 0 rules. Behind that, the
slow path's terminal step -- writing a rule -- still goes through the legacy
`save_rule_to_ltm` which emits the pre-test20 schema (top-level `rule` field,
no `condition`/`action`). The moment any non-identity rule is discovered, that
write trips F4 (rule lacking `condition` key) and would auto-revert. Iter 1
explicitly flagged this as the next gap. Smallest defensible step: stand up the
schema-aware writer (`save_rule`) plus `validate_rule` + `RuleSchemaError` in
`agent/memory.py`, with tests, without rewiring `active_agent.py` (call-site
migration is a separate step).

**Change**:
- `agent/memory.py` -- added `RuleSchemaError(ValueError)`, `validate_rule()`,
  and `save_rule()`. Validator enforces V1–V7 from `docs/RULE_FORMAT.md` §3
  with no external dependencies. V2 checks `agent.conditions.CONDITION_REGISTRY`;
  V3 tries `procedural_memory.DSL.apply.DSL_REGISTRY` and falls through to an
  empty dict (so until the DSL primitives land, every persisted-rule attempt
  correctly fails V3 — correct-by-construction). Legacy `save_rule_to_ltm` and
  all other existing exports left untouched.
- `tests/__init__.py` + `tests/test_save_rule.py` -- new dependency-free test
  runner (10 cases) covering V1–V7, side-effect freedom of `validate_rule`,
  empty-DSL-registry rejection, and a happy-path round-trip that monkeypatches
  in a stub DSL registry without touching any DSL Python file (no F3 trip).
- `docs/RULE_FORMAT.md` §7 -- implementation status table refreshed: schema
  writer marked implemented (iter 2), legacy writer marked still-present, tests
  marked added.

**Probe before**: score=0/3, rules=0, covers_mean=0.0
**Probe after** : (not re-run -- this iter does not affect the solve path)

**Invariants**:
- forbidden = none (manual diff vs HEAD shows F1 = 0 lines; F2/F3/F4/F5/F6 no
  matches; F7 no `pass`/`continue` near any `except RuleSchemaError`; F8 N/A
  since `agent/active_operators.py` untouched).
- positives: P1–P6 all unchanged. No rule file exists yet, so P1/P2/P3 stay at
  zero; `agent/conditions/` registry unchanged so P5 stays at 1; episodic
  writer still unwired so P4 stays at 0; `active_operators.py` not modified so
  P6 unchanged. This is a scaffolding iter — payoff lands when a future iter
  rewires `active_agent.py` from `save_rule_to_ltm` to `save_rule`.
- `tests/test_save_rule.py` runs clean: 10/10 OK locally.

**Infra note (unchanged from iter 1)**: `scripts/check_invariants.sh` still
calls `python3` which on this Windows host resolves to the MS Store stub, so
the check exits with rc=49. Invariants this iter were verified manually with
raw `git diff`. Replacing `python3` → `python` in that script is the
mechanical fix; deferred to its own iter to keep this iter's scope scoped.

**Next gap (note for future iter)**: Two parallel candidates, both genuinely
smallest:
  1. Migrate `agent/active_agent.py`'s import from `save_rule_to_ltm` to
     `save_rule`, supplying the §1 schema fields (condition/action/
     anti_unification_trace/etc.) from the pipeline's discovered rule. This
     activates the new writer. Cannot complete cleanly until V3 has at least
     one DSL primitive to recognise.
  2. Bootstrap `procedural_memory/DSL/` with the two permitted hand-coded
     primitives (`coloring`, `make_grid`) and a `DSL_REGISTRY`/`apply_DSL`
     dispatcher. Once that exists, V3 starts admitting rules and (1) becomes
     unblocked. This is the natural prerequisite of (1).

## Iter 3 -- 2026-05-13 -- branch test20

**Diagnosis**: The probe again solved 0/3 and saved 0 rules — same surface as
iters 1-2. Behind that, iter 2 stood up `save_rule()` + `validate_rule()` with
V3 ("unknown action.dsl") guarding writes, but the DSL primitive registry was
empty (no `procedural_memory/DSL/` package existed), so V3 unconditionally
rejected every rule. Iter 2's "Next gap" called out exactly this prerequisite.
Smallest defensible step: bootstrap the DSL package with the two permitted
hand-coded primitives (`coloring`, `make_grid`) plus the
`DSL_REGISTRY`/`apply_DSL` dispatcher — closed at two, the rest must be
discovered. No touch to `active_operators.py` or `memory.py`.

**Change**:
- `procedural_memory/DSL/__init__.py` (new) -- transitively imports `apply`,
  `coloring`, `make_grid` so registrations fire at first use.
- `procedural_memory/DSL/apply.py` (new) -- `DSL_REGISTRY`, the `register`
  decorator (rejects re-binding to a different callable; idempotent on same
  callable), and `apply_DSL(name, grid=None, **kwargs)` dispatcher with the
  `grid=None` path for grid-producing primitives like `make_grid`.
- `procedural_memory/DSL/coloring.py` (new) -- `coloring(grid, selection, color)`.
  Accepts a single coord or a list of coords; validates color in `0..9 ∪ {13}`
  (the wiki's transparent/erase sentinel); rejects bool-as-int; pure (deep-copies
  rows); raises `ValueError` on OOB or malformed selection.
- `procedural_memory/DSL/make_grid.py` (new) -- `make_grid(height, width, color)`.
  Strict positive-int / color validation; returns a fresh nested list with
  independent rows (no shared references).
- `tests/test_dsl.py` (new) -- 17 dependency-free cases covering: registry holds
  exactly {coloring, make_grid}; coloring single/list coords, transparent 13,
  invalid colors (incl. bool), OOB rejection, malformed-selection rejection,
  empty-selection identity, purity, bad-grid rejection; make_grid happy path,
  row independence, transparent 13, validation of all three args; `apply_DSL`
  dispatch for both primitives plus unknown-name `KeyError`.
- `.gitignore` -- added a re-include exception for `procedural_memory/DSL/` and
  `procedural_memory/DSL/*.py` so the DSL **source** is tracked while the
  learned `rule_NNN.json` data files remain ignored.
- `docs/RULE_FORMAT.md` §5 -- DSL registry table now lists `coloring` and
  `make_grid` with their implementation paths and the explicit closure note.
- `docs/RULE_FORMAT.md` §7 -- implementation status table refreshed: DSL
  package marked bootstrapped (iter 3); V3 note updated to "admits `coloring`
  and `make_grid`"; `tests/test_dsl.py` row added.

**Probe before**: score=0/3, rules=0, covers_mean=0.0
**Probe after** : (not re-run -- this iter does not affect the solve path; it
unlocks V3 so a future iter that calls `save_rule()` for a `coloring`/`make_grid`
action can finally produce a schema-compliant rule file).

**Invariants**:
- forbidden = none. Manually verified each (the `python3` MS Store stub
  prevents `scripts/check_invariants.sh` from running — same blocker as iters
  1-2). F1: 0 lines in frozen-file diff. F2: no new `_try_*`/`_apply_*` def.
  F3: the only `^\+.*@.*register\(` lines in the staged DSL diff are
  `@register("coloring")` and `@register("make_grid")` — both filtered by the
  checker's allow-list regex. (One docstring in `apply.py` initially mentioned
  the literal `@register(...)` shape and tripped the grep; rewritten to
  English-only and re-verified.) F4: no `rule_*.json` files exist. F5: no new
  paths under `semantic_memory/`. F6: no edits to `run_loop.sh` /
  `run_pipeline.sh` / `run_learn.py` / `run_1ktasks.py`. F7: no `try/except
  RuleSchemaError` added or modified. F8: `agent/active_operators.py`
  untouched.
- positives: P1 0.0 → 0.0, P2 0.0 → 0.0, P3 0.0 → 0.0, P4 0 → 0, P5 1 → 1,
  P6 unchanged. **Genuinely neutral on auto-measured signals** — this is
  scaffolding work: V3 was the gate that kept P1/P2/P3 stuck at zero; it now
  admits two primitive names. The next iter that wires a real `save_rule()`
  call site or generalizes a `coloring`-based rule pays out the deltas.
- `tests/test_dsl.py`: 17/17 OK locally. `tests/test_save_rule.py`: 10/10
  still OK (the `test_v3_when_dsl_registry_empty` case still passes because
  its rule uses `action.dsl="stub_for_test"`, which is in neither the real
  registry nor the test stub — V3 fires with the same `unknown action.dsl`
  message).

**Infra note (unchanged from iters 1-2)**: `scripts/check_invariants.sh` calls
`python3`, which on this Windows host is the MS Store stub (prints "Python",
exits 49). Snapshot at `logs/_invariant_snapshot.json` is 0 bytes. Replacing
`python3` → `python` in that script remains the mechanical fix, intentionally
deferred so this iter stays scoped to the DSL bootstrap.

**Next gap (note for future iter)**: With V3 now admitting `coloring` and
`make_grid`, two parallel candidates again share "smallest defensible":
  1. Fix the `python3` → `python` invocation in `scripts/check_invariants.sh`
     so the automated invariant check actually runs on this host. Pure
     plumbing; ~1 line edit; unblocks every future iter's auto-verification.
  2. Wire `program/anti_unification.py:unify()` into
     `agent/memory.py:save_rule()` per CLAUDE.md §8. Currently `unify()` is a
     stub and `save_rule()` never calls it, so P3 (`anti_unification_trace`
     fraction) can never move. The integration is small (≤20 LOC at the call
     site) but it needs a real `unify()` body or a placeholder that emits the
     trace shape from `docs/ANTI_UNIFICATION.md` (which doesn't exist yet).
The infra fix (1) is genuinely smaller and unblocks measurement.

## Iter 4 -- 2026-05-13 -- branch test20

**Diagnosis**: Iters 1-3 all flagged the same infra blocker: `scripts/check_invariants.sh`
hardcoded `python3`, which on this Windows host is the Microsoft Store stub
(exits rc=49 without executing, garbles the script's exit accounting). The
snapshot file at `logs/_invariant_snapshot.json` was 0 bytes for three iters
straight, and the loop driver kept tagging each commit `[ERROR_49]` because its
post-check verdict was unreachable. With the measurement system silently dead,
no future iter could *honestly* report positive-signal deltas — every Δ would
collapse to the baseline regardless of work done. Iter 3's "Next gap" called
this out explicitly and ranked it ahead of wiring anti-unification, because
the fix is mechanical and unblocks all subsequent verification. Smallest
defensible step: make `scripts/check_invariants.sh` actually run end-to-end
on this host.

**Change**:
- `scripts/check_invariants.sh` -- (a) detect a working Python interpreter into
  `$PYTHON_BIN` (honours caller-pinned override; tries `python3` then `python`;
  validates each candidate with `-c "import sys"` so the MS Store stub is
  rejected by its rc=49). Replaced every hardcoded `python3` invocation with
  `"$PYTHON_BIN"` (4 sites: `compute_metrics` heredoc, BASE_HEAD extraction,
  F4 inner check, post-check positive-delta heredoc).
- `scripts/check_invariants.sh` -- (b) added `encoding="utf-8"` to every
  `open()` in the embedded Python (compute_metrics reads
  `agent/conditions/__init__.py` and `agent/conditions/*.py` which contain
  UTF-8 em-dashes/section-signs; on a Korean-locale Windows host `open()`
  defaults to cp949 and raised `UnicodeDecodeError` silently swallowed by the
  outer `2>/dev/null`). Both compute heredocs plus the F4 inner check now
  open files as UTF-8 explicitly.
- `scripts/check_invariants.sh` -- (c) call `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")`
  in both heredocs so the human-readable output (Δ, ↑, ↓, ·, →) renders
  without cp949 mojibake.
- `scripts/check_invariants.sh` -- (d) hardened `--snapshot` mode: propagate
  `compute_metrics`'s exit code instead of unconditionally `exit 0`, and
  refuse to leave a 0-byte snapshot on disk. Post-check heredoc surfaces a
  non-zero exit from the recompute subprocess instead of silently treating an
  empty stdout as `{}`.
- `scripts/check_invariants.sh` -- (e) made the P5 snapshot and recompute
  paths agree on the matcher-count regex. Snapshot previously summed
  `@register(` plus `CONDITION_REGISTRY\[['"]` which double-counted the
  docstring example on line 30 of `agent/conditions/__init__.py`; the
  recompute path used only `@register(`. After the fix, both paths use only
  `@register(`. P5 is now consistently 1 on the current tree (one matcher
  registered: `grid_size_preserved`). An unchanged repo no longer registers
  as P5: -1.

**Probe before**: score=0/3, rules=0, covers_mean=0.0  (loop's iter-4 probe;
identical to iters 1-3 since the slow path is still unwired).
**Probe after** : (not re-run -- this iter does not affect the solve path; it
unblocks the verification *measurement* that runs after every future iter).

**Invariants**:
- forbidden = none. Verified via the now-working checker against base HEAD
  `e65cd282` (iter 3): F1 0-line diff in frozen-file paths; F2 no `+def _try_`
  / `+def _apply_`; F3 untouched DSL Python; F4 no rule files exist; F5 no
  `semantic_memory/.*[Tt][Ff]_` paths added; F6 no edits to `run_loop.sh` /
  `run_pipeline.sh` / `run_learn.py` / `run_1ktasks.py`; F7 no `except
  RuleSchemaError` changes; F8 `agent/active_operators.py` untouched
  (numstat 0/0). The checker itself now runs cleanly end-to-end (exit 0 for
  snapshot, exit 2 for check on unchanged metrics) instead of exiting 49.
- positives: P1 0.0 → 0.0, P2 0.0 → 0.0, P3 0.0 → 0.0, P4 0 → 0, P5 1 → 1,
  P6 600 → 600. **Neutral on auto-measured signals** — this is pure
  measurement infra. The payoff is that every *subsequent* iter's
  positive-delta accounting will now be real instead of stuck-at-zero by a
  broken interpreter. There is no honest P1–P6 delta to claim for fixing the
  ruler; the ruler's correctness is a precondition for future Δ claims, not
  itself a Δ.
- `tests/test_save_rule.py`: 10/10 OK. `tests/test_dsl.py`: 17/17 OK. (Both
  ran via direct `python tests/test_X.py` since pytest is unavailable in this
  env; matches the dependency-free runner iters 2-3 stood up.)

**Infra note (resolved by this iter)**: The `python3` MS Store stub blocker
flagged in iters 1-3 is gone — `scripts/check_invariants.sh --snapshot`
produces a valid JSON snapshot on this host, and `--check` against an
unchanged-state baseline exits 2 (NEUTRAL) cleanly.

**Next gap (note for future iter)**: With measurement unblocked, the next
smallest-defensible step is to wire `program/anti_unification.py:unify()`
into `agent/memory.py:save_rule()` per CLAUDE.md §8. `unify()` is currently
a stub and `save_rule()` never calls it, so P3 (`anti_unification_trace`
fraction) is structurally pinned at 0 even when rules exist. The integration
itself is small (≤20 LOC at the call site) but needs either a real `unify()`
body or a minimal placeholder that emits the trace shape documented in
(still-to-be-written) `docs/ANTI_UNIFICATION.md`. Parallel candidate of
similar size: migrate `agent/active_agent.py`'s import from
`save_rule_to_ltm` to `save_rule` so the schema-aware writer actually fires
on the solve path — but that one has more surface area in the call site,
making the anti-unification wiring slightly smaller.
